class Human {
    // This is a class
}

// https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.inheritance.php

class Homme extends Human {
    // This is a class that inherits from Human, it inherits all the attributes and methods of Human
}

class Femme extends Human {
    // This is a class that inherits from Human, it inherits all the attributes and methods of Human
}

We would do inheritance if we want to have a class that is a more specific version of another class,
for example, Homme and Femme are both Humans, but they have different attributes and methods.
Another reason to do inheritance is to avoid code duplication, for example, if we have a class
Human with a method walk(), and we want to create a class Homme and a class Femme, we would
have to write the method walk() in both classes, but if we do inheritance, we can just write the
method walk() in the class Human, and the classes Homme and Femme will inherit the method walk()
from the class Human.
